Event handling
Event propagation
Event Bubbling
Event capturing


- Event propagation 
- Whenever event triggers (click , change) , it can propagate through DOM tree from target to anncestor
- Two phases 
 - capturing  -> root(parent) to target element (child)
 - bubbling   -> target element to anncestor (parent or document) 
 - target phase -> event triggers on target element
