- How arrays in different in js from java?

Arrays in java have the elements of homogenous type

String arr[]= new String[];  // java
 arr= {"hello","world"}

var arr=[1,2,4,"hello","world",true]; // JS

Arrays in js can have heterogenous type 


- In js we can store arrays and objects in js array unlike in java
- Arrays in js are dynamic which means length can be shrink or increased as per add or pop
- Arrays in Java are static

int arr[]= new int[10];

- we have function as parameter in a function then the param function will be executed
- left to right params are going to be added to array
arr.push(45,56,'hello',N,45,N+1)

- Slice in arrays 
- Doesnt original array
- slice(startindex,endingindex)  
- endingindex exclusive


// some()

- It is used to check for a certain condition and it should be true atleast once then some() return true
