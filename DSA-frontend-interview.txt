Interview advance in js -

1. // we have an array of numbers , design a method in which it takes the array
 and remove the duplicates and return new array (Only use HOF)

 arr = [1,2,3,3,2,1,3] 
 o/p = [1,2,3]  //order doesnt matter


  1// bruteforce using for loop (sort)
  2// only you can use filter,map,reduce,arrays methods (not sort)
